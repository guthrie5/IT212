                A techie, video game enthusiast and collector of vintage video games and consoles. I've spent most of my
                life taking it day by day and rolling with
                what life has given me. When shit hits the fan, I'm known for saying, "I'll figure it out", and, so far,
                I've
                done just that.
                <br><br>
                Having done various forms of customer serivce and technical support through my years, I've become quite
                a bit of
                a junkie for helping people. My focus has always been problem solving and nothing makes me prouder than
                finding
                a solution to a problem that has been plaguing people!
                <br><br>
                My plan has been to go back to school for 10 years now, and, finally, that plan has come to fruition!
                While mobile
                application development is my major, I've definitely found enjoyment learning HTML and CSS. Being
                able to create something and with a small tweak here or there seeing it change before my very eyes is
                quite
                enjoyable.
